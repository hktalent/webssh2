## 0.4.0 [20210519]
### BREAKING

### Changes
- Removed HTML menu code from ./app/server/socket.js, the menu is now fully laid out in the ./app/client/src/index.html and the option elements are hidden by default. Not sure why it wasn't done this way from the start, but there it is.
- Updated socket.io to v4.1.1

### CONTRIBUTING
In this release, we're trying our best to conform to the [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/projects/javascript/). I'm hoping this will make contributions easier and keep the code readable. I love shortcuts more than anyone but I've found when making changes to code I've not looked at in a while, it can take me a few momements to deconstruct what was being done due to readbility issues. While I don't agree with every decision in the style guide (semi-colons, yuk), it is a good base to keep the code consistent.

If you've not used it before, I recommend installing the [vscode extensions](https://blog.echobind.com/integrating-prettier-eslint-airbnb-style-guide-in-vscode-47f07b5d7d6a) for that and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and getting familiar. The autocorrections are great (especially if you hate dealing with semi-colons...)

As of 0.4.0-testing-0, the client code is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html). It's not that much different from JavaScript, and the introduction strong typing will ultimately help to produce better code. Eventually we want to move the whole project to TypeScript but that make take a bit more time. Take a moment to look at ./app/client/src/js/index.ts to see what TypeScript looks like.
## 0.3.1 [20210513]
### BREAKING
- Ability to configure CORS settings for socket.io see [#240](../../issues/240) for more information on how this may break existing deployments. Default settings in example `config.json` are currently permissive `http.origins: ["*:*"]` please note that if a `config.json` is not present, the default is `http.origins: ["localhost:2222"]

## 0.1.1 [2017-06-03]
### Added
- `serverlog.client` and `serverlog.server` options added to `config.json` to enable logging of client commands to server log (only client portion implemented at this time)
- morgan express middleware for logging
### Changed

## 0.1.0 [2017-05-27]
### Added
- This ChangeLog.md file
- Support for UTF-8 characters (thanks @bara666)
- Snyk, Bithound, Travis CI
- Cross platform improvements (path mappings)
- Session fixup between Express and Socket.io
- Session secret settings in `config.json`
- env variable `DEBUG=ssh2` will put the `ssh2` module into debug mode
- env variable `DEBUG=WebSSH2` will output additional debug messages for functions
and events in the application (not including the ssh2 module debug)
- using Grunt to pull js and css source files from other modules `npm run build` to rebuild these if changed or updated.
- `useminified` option in `config.json` to enable using minified client side javascript (true) defaults to false (non-minified)
- sshterm= query option to specify TERM environment variable for host, valid strings are alpha-numeric with a hypen (validated). Otherwise the default ssh.term variable from `config.json` will be used.
- validation for host (v4,v6,fqdn,hostname), port (integer 2-65535), and header (sanitized) from URL input

### Changed
- error handling in public/client.js
- moved socket.io operations to their own file /socket/index.js, more changes like this to come (./socket/index.js)
- all session based variables are now under the req.session.ssh property or socket.request.ssh (./index.js)
- moved SSH algorithms to `config.json` and defined as a session variable (..session.ssh.algorithms)
-- prep for future feature to define algorithms in header or some other method to enable separate ciphers per host
- minified and combined all js files to a single js in `./public/webssh2.min.js` also included a sourcemap `./public/webssh2.min.js` which maps to `./public/webssh2.js` for easier troubleshooting.
- combined all css files to a single css in `./public/webssh2.css`
- minified all css files to a single css in `./public/webssh2.min.css`
- copied all unmodified source css and js to /public/src/css and /public/src/js respectively (for troubleshooting/etc)
- sourcemaps of all minified code (in /public/src and /public/src/js)
- renamed `client.htm` to `client-full.htm`
- created `client-min.htm` to serve minified javascript
- if header.text is null in `config.json` and header is not defined as a get parameter the Header will not be displayed. Both of these must be null / undefined and not specified as get parameters.

### Fixed
- Multiple errors may overwrite status bar which would cause confusion as to what originally caused the error. Example, ssh server disconnects which prompts a cascade of events (conn.on('end'), socket.on('disconnect'), conn.on('close')) and the original reason (conn.on('end')) would be lost and the user would erroneously receive a WEBSOCKET error as the last event to fire would be the websocket connection closing from the app.
- ensure ssh session is closed when a browser disconnects from the websocket
- if headerBackground is changed, status background is changed to the same color (typo, fixed)

### Removed
- Express Static References directly to module source directories due to concatenating and minifying js/css

## 0.0.5 - [2017-03-23]
